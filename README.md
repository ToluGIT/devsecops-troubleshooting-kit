## Mission Statement

In a world where a single misconfiguration can lead to a massive data breach, this kit serves as an operations manual for:

- **Threat Detection** - Identify security issues 

- **Systematic Vulnerability Resolution** - Fix problems the right way, the first time
- **Proactive Security Hardening** - Build defense in depth across your entire stack
- **Incident Response Excellence** - When things go wrong, respond like accordingly

## Why This Kit Exists

### The Reality Check


It exists because:

- **Security can't be an afterthought** - It must be baked into every layer
- **Traditional DevOps guides miss critical security angles** - We fill that gap
- **attacks demand defenses** - Theory isn't enough
- **Every team member needs security skills** - Not just the security team
- **Speed and security must coexist** - One shouldn't sacrifice the other

### Who This Kit Serves

- **DevSecOps Engineers** - Your daily companion for secure operations
- **Security Engineers** - Bridge the gap between security and operations
- **Site Reliability Engineers** - Keep systems reliable AND secure
- **Cloud Security Architects** - Design and troubleshoot secure cloud infrastructure
- **Incident Response Teams** - Your playbook when every second counts
- **Developers** - Write secure code and understand security implications
- **Compliance Teams** - Ensure systems meet security standards

## Quick Start Security Check

### Emergency Security Triage (Copy & Run)

```bash
# System-wide security scan
echo " QUICK SECURITY AUDIT"

# Check for exposed secrets in running processes
ps auxe | grep -E "(api_key|password|secret|token)" | grep -v grep

# Find world-writable files (potential backdoors)
find / -type f -perm -002 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Check for suspicious network connections
netstat -tulpn | grep -E "(0.0.0.0:|:::)" | grep -v "127.0.0.1"

# Identify processes running as root
ps aux | grep "^root" | grep -v "\[" | head -10

# Check for failed login attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -20

# Container security quick check
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep -E "(0.0.0.0:|:::)"

# Kubernetes security posture
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.spec.securityContext}{"\n"}{end}' | grep -v "null"
```

### Vulnerability Assessment

netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

#### Privilege Escalation Attempts

## Breach Scenarios

### Case Study 

The scenario library includes detailed walkthroughs of security incidents:

1. **The S3 Bucket Misconfiguration** - How a single setting exposed millions of records
2. **The Jenkins Pipeline Hijack** - When CI/CD becomes an attack vector  
3. **The Kubernetes Dashboard Exposure** - Default settings that led to cluster compromise
4. **The npm Supply Chain Attack** - How malicious packages infiltrated thousands of apps
5. **The Docker Socket Mount Mistake** - Container escape through misconfiguration

Each scenario includes:
- Initial indicators
- Investigation steps
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation actions
- Lessons learned
- Prevention strategies

### Remember: Security is not a product, but a process 

**"The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards."**
*- Gene Spafford*

But since we can't do that, let's make our systems as secure as practically possible!
